Estimated Hours
---------------------
I spent roughly around 2-3 hours on learning, but also spent time learning via testing and trial-and-error.

Content Insights
---------------------
I learnt that you can use Child Themes in Wordpress.org to edit the theme, without touching the main theme. This is a good idea, incase you make an unrecoverable mistake, or if there's an update to the theme and it overrides all work.
I also utilised a pre-made theme, so I can start developing a website, without worrying about having to make a theme from scratch.
While I had previously learnt markdown for previous subjects, it had been a while since I last used it, and had to re-learn some of the basics.
I learnt a little bit into making a form with HTML, that will send to the Wordpress admin email, verify and validate with JavaScript, and tidy up the form with CSS. However, this was unable to be configured to work, and had to be scrapped.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
---------------------
From my previous learning methods, I prefer to either learn a small chunk then apply in practice, or learning something that can be used as a solution, or put into practice for a section of the project that was unfinished.
Child themes gives me a wider knowledge range into css that I was unfamiliar with prior.
While using forms would be an impressive aspect of the website, it was removed for brevity of work effort that could be focused on other parts of the website.
